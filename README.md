# Flight-fare-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop an application which will 
predict the flight prices for various flights using machine 
learning model. The user will get the predicted values and with 
its reference the user can decide to book their tickets 
accordingly,based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, 
what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.
